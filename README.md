This started with me frustrated needing a pricing slider for a client. It was difficult, even for seasoned coders it would take a long time. This would shortcut that. 

I learned about: 
  addEventListeneres 
  How to create tokens 
  Using external scripts for the color picker. Specifically pickr. 
  Exporting code for users 
  Setting up a server
  and so much more
